## Introduction
In our modern digital age, the use of our medical data, a crucial facet of our digital identity, raises profound questions about its implications. As people willingly -or not, divulge it, this kind of data sharing contributes to the formation of what can be considered one of our digital identities. By digital identity, we actually encompass all online data specific to a given individual, which roughly means online activities and behaviours, personal and financial information, credentials, and, obviously, medical and biometric data. Awareness of the risks associated with our digital footprint is vital in today's world, where technology is omnipresent. As we will see later on, the stakes are inherently high for we have no control over the impact of their exploitation, especially in an increasingly interconnected world such as ours. As we have said, this particular part of our digital identity which is our medical profile, gives rise to menaces, necessitating a comprehensive examination of the ethical, privacy, and more global security concerns entwined with its collection, use, and presumed misuse. In this essay, we will delve into this topic by looking first at the state of technology in the medical field and our current understanding of it. We will then look at the risks entailed, both those we know about and those we can only speculate about. Finally, we will discuss the means we can deploy to protect ourselves from these abuses.


## Technology and Medicine
### Healthcare and the ever-growing use of technology
Medical data landscape has seen formidable change as a result of technological breakthroughs, which have led to numerous positive developments. The accessibility of healthcare data has been significantly transformed by the widespread use of Electronic Health Records and, more generally, by the digitalisation of medical information. Important data can now be retrieved faster and effortlessly thanks to this evolution, which is of great value in emergencies. Furthermore, a significant shift has taken place, as patients are now actively involved in the data collection process via genetic testing kits or healthcare applications, for example.
Technology integration not only renders information more easily accessible but also makes data sharing simpler. Interconnected systems have enabled the swift exchange of medical history records; the pooled data is a priceless resource for studying human genomes, improving therapeutic approaches, and making discoveries that contribute to public health development[^1].
All of this combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning played a pivotal role in leveraging medical data. It has indeed proven effective in improving healthcare outcomes, mostly by unlocking new research possibilities and finding successful applications in predictive analytics and disease surveillance: scientists can efficiently analyse massive datasets, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions[^3] [^4].
To put it simply, technology has started being integrated into the medical field to the point that no coming back is now possible, as they would not be able to make further progress without.

### Current understanding of technologies’ implications
While our understanding of the sensitivity of our data and the implications of technology has grown in the recent years, our actual awareness of the privacy issues tied to the collection and use of medical data remains vague. Questions of ethics and moral dilemmas have arisen, among them issues around consent, data ownership, and the commodification of health information. Doubts have also been expressed about potential biases in algorithms used for patient treatment[^2]. Such fears have grown more and more prevalent as technology becomes ever more integrated into the healthcare sector, encouraging a critical examination of the dimensions built into these automated decision-making systems and piling another layer of complexity to the ethical landscape[^5]. And since governments and authorities have come to understand how important it is to safeguard medical data, the focus has turned toward these challenges. However, despite the increased interest taken in the problem, some problems remain obscure, making it difficult to come to universal agreements on both the ethical and privacy risks of using medical data: actually, each country or entity, such as the European Union, produces its own legislations, yet there are still many shortcomings in the laws regulating the handling of healthcare data, implying the need for a constant and deeper reflection on the subject, balanced by a nuanced and critical look, not to mention the need for an effort to bridge the gap between awareness and concrete solutions.


## Positive improvements raising threats
### Hypothetical data misuse on an individual’s scale
Despite its proven benefits, pressing concerns about technology implementation in the medical field have grown over the years. First of all, cybercriminals often target individuals' sensitive data stored in digital platforms, as it contains highly personal information as well as patient histories, diagnoses, and treatments. This can not only lead to identity theft and healthcare and financial fraud but also impact individual well-being since attackers can use the stolen information to impersonate individuals, open fraudulent accounts, or access healthcare services upon victims’ accounts (and this would compromise both the healthcare systems’ integrity and the patient’s care)[^5].

There is also a potential for discriminatory practices, with stolen data serving profiling purposes and consequently creating a tool for the denial of insurance or employment opportunities[^5]. As a matter of fact, in the realm of insurance, the discriminatory use of medical data could be translated into individuals being denied coverage, reinforcing inequalities. Similarly, employers provided with detailed medical profiles might engage in discriminatory hiring practices: candidates could be prejudiced based on their health, violating the very fundamental principles of fairness and equal opportunity. On top of that, people could also get discriminated in everyday’s situations, as, for example, priority care could be given to people who would meet certain criteria before others.

Besides these theoretical issues, the compromised data could bring direct threats such as blackmailing, when an ill-intentioned person exploits the sensitive information to coerce someone into compliance with their demands[^6]. It could even be brought to imagination that, with today’s impressive development of AI, convincing deepfakes could be created. All of these possibilities would put at stake people’s integrity and dignity, menacing their personal and professional lives and, generally speaking, their public image.

Ultimately, another layer of risk could rest upon people: data monetisation. Indeed, data represents a powerful tool in capitalistic and profit-driven settings, and some may be tempted to place financial gains over people's well-being. Pharmaceutical and insurance companies, for example, find great value in its acquisition and resale, since it is perceived as a mean of trade and even sometimes as leverage: indeed, information-based power asymmetry gives an edge to those who possess the data, and it is today known as ransomware[^6].

Finally, it could be pointed out that one of the challenges we face today lies in finding the right balance between the moral and necessary use of people's medical data while recognising the possibility of its unethical and illegal misuse.


### Global security threats 
 The growing integration of technologies in the medical world has raised concerns about threats to global security in addition to individual threats, forcing us to confront our current vulnerabilities.
Indeed, the possibility of hacking and privacy breaches is one major issue that poses serious risks to society as a whole. Confidential information like disease outbreaks or progress in medicine could be compromised, which could lead to misinformation, public panic, and compromised efforts to handle public health crises.

Cyber-attacks on healthcare systems can have serious consequences, from the compromise of sensitive patient data to the disruption of essential medical services. Indeed, as we have seen, healthcare systems are increasingly reliant on interconnected technologies to manage patient records, facilitate communication between healthcare professionals, and even run life-saving devices. A successful cyber-attack could potentially paralyse these systems, causing chaos in hospitals and other facilities. Patient care could also be compromised as healthcare providers could struggle to access essential information, leading to delays in diagnosis, treatment, and overall healthcare delivery[^6]. And just as we can't predict why criminals would do this, we can't predict the extent of the consequences. The implications of cyber-attacks are unpredictable, and while we can anticipate certain outcomes, we can't fully comprehend all of them. 

A good example of how fragile the balance of our systems is and how confidence can easily be shaken is the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on public health management. It has shown how false information can cause panic among individuals and complicate the challenges faced by healthcare systems. Conspiracies, rumours, and inaccurate assertions regarding the virus's origins and mode of transmission have all fuelled a climate of fear. And if this kind of behaviour occurs in such circumstances, we might try to consider what it would be like in the case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, we should constantly question the use of our digital data and be on the lookout for any eventuality.

Furthermore, interruptions to essential medical services go beyond the confines of immediate healthcare. Most people are putting an increasing amount of personal data on digital platforms and for now entrust technology. However, public trust in the healthcare system would be damaged in the event of a cyber-attack, creating a knock-on effect on people's willingness to seek medical attention and follow recommendations, thus exacerbating the potential compromise of healthcare institutions' overall functionality and efficiency. In addition, from a broader perspective, these kinds of events could foster a sense of vulnerability and erode people's trust in financial institutions and governmental systems[^7].

Finally, extreme possibilities are raising growing apprehension, recalling the dystopian scenarios portrayed in works such as George Orwell's "1984". Risks of mass surveillance and government overreach, raise ethical concerns and questions about the loss of privacy rights in the face of technological advances. Could the violation of our private data signal a future violation of rights, to the most fundamental ones? Questions such as these could invite us to speculate on extreme comparisons with the Orwellian predictions of a society marked by omnipresent surveillance and control, leading to supposed problematic outcomes linked to origin, gender, or even personal beliefs[^8]. 

In the end, this piling up of technological advances and potential risks thus calls for a careful examination of safeguards, legal frameworks, and ethical considerations to prevent the manifestation of dystopian narratives in our contemporary reality.


## Mitigation strategies: how to prevent ourselves from “the worst”?
### Regulatory Frameworks:
With the growing reliance on digitalisation, the need for robust legal regulations to protect our digital identity has become a necessity. To secure sensitive data from the numerous potential risks we have discussed until now, an extensive and comprehensive approach must be developed, first and foremost through the implementation of regulatory frameworks designed to set standards and enforce guidelines for it to be responsibly handled. 

When it comes to control mechanisms, some have already been deployed, especially in the US, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) signed in 1996, which brought national standards and a legal foundation for patient information’s confidentiality [^1] [^5]. The HIPAA Act has since then been supplemented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which encourages the adoption of electronic health records and expands the scope of privacy and security protection first stated. In addition, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015 fosters collaboration between government and private entities to improve information sharing on cybersecurity threats, contributing to a more proactive and collaborative defence against the ever-changing array of threats. More generally, outside the American continent, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a notable example of a regulatory framework developed to protect individuals to the fullest extent possible, based on our current awareness: extending beyond the healthcare sphere, it does not only set strict rules for data protection but also imposes significant sanctions in the event of non-compliance[^1] [^5]. The GDPR also focuses more on the rights of individuals and restates how consent to data processing is a core issue. As of today, many other various regulatory frameworks exist in order to strengthen the protection of medical data, relative to each country and their views on the matter[^9].

In a nutshell, these frameworks, although likely flawed and refinable, seek to mitigate risk and ensure the responsible handling of medical data on a worldwide scale; and while a strong foundation may have been built, it is important to remember that, like the constant development of technology, our laws must continue to adapt to the emerging threats.


### Technological Safeguards:
Complementing regulatory frameworks, technological safeguards emerge as the last crucial line of defence we could evoke in this essay against the dangers previously stated. 

Prominent measures like encryption and secure data storage via blockchain stand at the forefront of efforts to reinforce the digital legal frameworks already existing. Many regulatory frameworks and data protection laws, as those we have seen already, mandate their use[^10]. Encryption, the process of converting readable data into an unreadable form thanks to a mathematical algorithm, serves as a layer of security to transmit and store information, as encrypted data is essentially meaningless without the decryption key. As for blockchain, a shared database using cryptography to safely record and store information through the usual mean of a ledger, its decentralised nature of blockchain is the key to data security as it disperses information, and its transparent and immutability nature (meaning it cannot be altered nor deleted) make it inherently resistant to unwanted tampering[^6] [^10]. Other safeguards do exist, primarily in the form of Secure Communication Protocols, like the Transport Layer Security (TLS), a widely adopted protocol designed to ensure the confidentiality and security of data on the Internet; all of them play a pivotal role in securing the transmission of sensitive information[^9].

In brief, these security mechanisms ensure the integrity of healthcare information -and information in general, as it travels through interconnected networks, supplementing existing legal safeguards. Over time, these encryption systems will continue to develop in response to new risks, hence the growing demand for cybersecurity specialists over the last few years.


## Conclusion
In this age of technology, our medical data are in part defining our digital identity, which inevitably raises crucial questions about privacy and security. Technological advances brought to the medical field and also fuelled by the health data shared with our healthcare providers or that we provide on our own, not only make care more accessible but also more effective, but they also come with growing dangers. This dual nature of medical data use is a reminder that balancing the potential for innovation with the need for security is a critical challenge for today as for tomorrow. As we have stated what is the common understanding of digital identity linked to the medical field today, we have then highlighted the risks, from a micro to a macro level, stemming from the increasing integration of technology, to finally have an overlook of how we could prevent ourselves best from these existential menaces. Through continuous reflection, there is no doubt we will be able to keep navigating the digital health landscape safely.


## Recommendations
After analysing the current threats resting upon us, I could only advise people to always try to stay in a constant state of learning and awareness when it comes to how we use and with whom we share our data, as well as embracing a proactive stance in understanding technology development, uses and implications. Such commitment will for sure empower individuals and lead them to make informed decisions but also keep them from fearing what is nowadays a powerful tool.
