# What are the potential implications of widespread digitalisation of medical data?

## Introduction
In our modern digital age, the use of our medical data, a crucial facet of our digital identity, raises profound questions about its implications. As we willingly -or not, divulge it, we contribute to forming what can be considered one of our digital identities. By digital identity we actually encompass all online data specific to a given individual, which roughly means  online activities and behaviours, personal and financial information, credentials, and, obviously, medical and biometric data. Awareness of the risks associated with our digital footprint is vital in today's world, where technology is omnipresent. As we will see later on, the stakes are inherently high for we have no control over the impact of their exploitation, especially in an increasingly interconnected world such as ours. As we have said, this particular part of our digital identity that is our medical profile, gives rise to menaces, necessitating a comprehensive examination of the ethical, privacy, and more global security concerns entwined with its collection, use, and presumed misuse. In this essay, we will delve into this topic by looking first at the state of technology in the medical field and our current understanding of it. We will then look at the risks entailed, both those we know about and those we can only speculate about. Finally, we will discuss the means we can deploy to protect ourselves from these abuses.


## As of today, technology is intrinsically linked to medicine
### Technologies are more and more widely integrated to the process of medical data:
ADD REFERENCES => Medical data landscape has seen formidable change as a result of technological breakthroughs, which have led to numerous positive developments. The accessibility of healthcare data has been significantly transformed by the widespread use of Electronic Health Records and, more generally, by the digitalisation of medical information. Important data can now be retrieved faster and effortlessly thanks to this evolution, which is of great value in emergencies. Furthermore, a significant shift has taken place, as patients are now actively involved in the data collection process via genetic testing kits or healthcare applications, for example.
Technology integration not only renders information more easily accessible but also makes data sharing easier. Interconnected systems have enabled the swift exchange of medical history records; the pooled data is a priceless resource for studying human genomes, improving therapeutic approaches, and making discoveries that contribute to public health development.
All of this combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning played a pivotal role in leveraging medical data. It has indeed proven effective in improving healthcare outcomes, mostly by unlocking new research possibilities and finding successful applications in predictive analytics and disease surveillance: scientists can efficiently analyse massive datasets, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions.
To put it simply, technology has started being integrated into the medical field to the point that no coming back is now possible, as they would not be able to make further progress without.

### We have these days a better understanding of technologies’ implications, yet our actual awareness remains hazy:
TO DVP => Currently, we know of privacy challenges associated with the collection and use of medical data, and how sensitive it is. The topic has grown more and more throughout the years as technology got widespread.  Ethical Considerations arose (dilemmas surrounding consent, data ownership, commodification of health information) and fears around potential biased algorithms used for patients’ treatment emerged. Governments and authorities began to take interest in the matter, but seeing how vague and undefinable certain problems we are confronted with are, no worldwide agreements have been reached.


## If, at first glance, this may seem to be a positive development, it raises a number of existential risks 
### As technologies are playing a more important role in the medical world, more people are trying to draw attention on global security threats they could bring:
TO DVP => Hacking and privacy breaches
Risks of cyberattacks on healthcare systems + potential consequences for individuals and society
Very limited law protection and institutional vulnerabilities
Extreme possibilities (tho we can already see some example in China): surveillance and government overreach
EG of data breaches and their impact on trust in healthcare systems or comparison to what could possibly happen (predictions tho) = 1984


### And the misuse of this data, even if hypothetical, is cause for concern even on an individual’s scale:
TO DVP => Potential misuse of medical data for discriminatory purposes, such as denial of insurance or employment.
= Data profiling and discrimination
What could eg happen? Blackmailing, identity theft and deepfakes
Dark side of data monetization + risk of profit-driven practices at the expense of individual well-being => Data sharing, manipulation, resale and monetization EXPLAIN how it is actually valuable for pharmaceutical or insurance companies for example


## Mitigation strategies: what can we on our level to prevent ourselves from “the worst”?
### Regulatory Frameworks:
RESEARCH => Potential regulatory measures to safeguard medical data + new entities such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in protecting patient information.

### Technological Safeguards:
RESEARCH => Technological/engineering improvements: encryption, secure data storage, and other technological measures to protect medical data // role of blockchain and decentralized technologies in enhancing data security.


## Conclusion
TO DVP => Balancing Innovation and Security:
Dual nature of medical data utilization, balancing the potential for innovation with the need for security.
Importance of ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and technological safeguards in mitigating risks.
