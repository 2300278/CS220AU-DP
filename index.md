# What are the potential implications of widespread digitalisation of medical data?

## Keywords
Digital ethics


## Introduction
In our modern digital age, the use of our medical data, a crucial facet of our digital identity, raises profound questions about its implications. As people willingly -or not, divulge it, this kind of data sharing contributes to the formation of what can be considered one of our digital identities. By digital identity we actually encompass all online data specific to a given individual, which roughly means online activities and behaviours, personal and financial information, credentials, and, obviously, medical and biometric data. Awareness of the risks associated with our digital footprint is vital in today's world, where technology is omnipresent. As we will see later on, the stakes are inherently high for we have no control over the impact of their exploitation, especially in an increasingly interconnected world such as ours. As we have said, this particular part of our digital identity that is our medical profile, gives rise to menaces, necessitating a comprehensive examination of the ethical, privacy, and more global security concerns entwined with its collection, use, and presumed misuse. In this essay, we will delve into this topic by looking first at the state of technology in the medical field and our current understanding of it. We will then look at the risks entailed, both those we know about and those we can only speculate about. Finally, we will discuss the means we can deploy to protect ourselves from these abuses.


## Technology and Medicine
### Healthcare and the ever-growing use of technology
ADD REFERENCES => Medical data landscape has seen formidable change as a result of technological breakthroughs, which have led to numerous positive developments. The accessibility of healthcare data has been significantly transformed by the widespread use of Electronic Health Records and, more generally, by the digitalisation of medical information. Important data can now be retrieved faster and effortlessly thanks to this evolution, which is of great value in emergencies. Furthermore, a significant shift has taken place, as patients are now actively involved in the data collection process via genetic testing kits or healthcare applications, for example.
Technology integration not only renders information more easily accessible but also makes data sharing simpler. Interconnected systems have enabled the swift exchange of medical history records; the pooled data is a priceless resource for studying human genomes, improving therapeutic approaches, and making discoveries that contribute to public health development.
All of this combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning played a pivotal role in leveraging medical data. It has indeed proven effective in improving healthcare outcomes, mostly by unlocking new research possibilities and finding successful applications in predictive analytics and disease surveillance: scientists can efficiently analyse massive datasets, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions.
To put it simply, technology has started being integrated into the medical field to the point that no coming back is now possible, as they would not be able to make further progress without.

### Current understanding of technologies’ implications
While our understanding of the sensitivity of our data and the implications of technology has grown in the recent years, our actual awareness of the privacy issues tied to the collection and use of medical data remains vague. Questions of ethics and moral dilemmas have arisen, among them issues around consent, data ownership, and the commodification of health information. Doubts have also been expressed about potential biases in algorithms used for patient treatment. Such fears have grown more and more prevalent as technology becomes ever more integrated into the healthcare sector, encouraging a critical examination of the dimensions built into these automated decision-making systems and piling another layer of complexity to the ethical landscape. And since governments and authorities have come to understand how important it is to safeguard medical data, the focus has turned toward these challenges. However, despite the increased interest taken in the problem, some problems stay obscure, making it difficult to come to global agreements on both the ethical and privacy risks of using medical data: this absence of a universal framework highlights the uncertainties that persist when navigating these issues, increasingly alerting  citizens. In the end, the actual lack of clear definition around what technology in healthcare implies brings to the spotlight the constant need for a more in-depth reflection on the subject balanced by a nuanced and critical look, not to mention the need for an effort to bridge the gap between awareness and concrete solutions.


## If, at first glance, this may seem to be a positive development, it raises a number of existential risks 
### Hypothetical data misuse on an individual’s scale
Potential misuse of medical data for discriminatory purposes, such as denial of insurance or employment.
Hacking and privacy breaches: Cybercriminals target individuals' sensitive data stored in various digital platforms such as personally identifiable information (PII) and health records. The breach of such personal data can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and unauthorized access to sensitive accounts, jeopardizing the affected individuals' well-being and security.

= Data profiling and discrimination
What could eg happen? Blackmailing, identity theft and deepfakes
Dark side of data monetization + risk of profit-driven practices at the expense of individual well-being => Data sharing, manipulation, resale and monetization EXPLAIN how it is actually valuable for pharmaceutical or insurance companies for example


### Global security threats 
word document for now


## Mitigation strategies: what can we on our level to prevent ourselves from “the worst”?
### Regulatory Frameworks:
RESEARCH => Potential regulatory measures to safeguard medical data + new entities such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in protecting patient information.

### Technological Safeguards:
RESEARCH => Technological/engineering improvements: encryption, secure data storage, and other technological measures to protect medical data // role of blockchain and decentralized technologies in enhancing data security.


## Conclusion
TO DVP => Balancing Innovation and Security:
Dual nature of medical data utilization, balancing the potential for innovation with the need for security.
Importance of ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and technological safeguards in mitigating risks.
