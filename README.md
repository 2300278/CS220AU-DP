# CS220AU Digital Portfolio Template

## Portfolio Overview and Items
My portfolio includes the following components:

1. **this portfolio overview**: I provide here a succinct description of what can be found in my portfolio, along with a list of tasks to do (Tasks) and those already completed (Log) in this `README.md` file.
2. **my website**: hosting my essay, on which I have first discussed the considerations about the security of our medical data and its present and hypothetical use. Then I have dwelt on the means available to us to protect ourselves.
3. **the self- and peer-assessment**: through the `assessment.md` file.



## Disclaimer

To refine my writing, as I am not a native English-speaker, I have used tools such as Quillbot and ChatGPT.
