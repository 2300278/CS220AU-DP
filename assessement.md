## Self-assessment
Using the marking rubric, I've assessed my own progress: <!-- move the symbols in the table below -->

Throughout the semester, I worked quite regularly on this essay, as it was important to have made progress on it so that I could bring my questions to class. I read a number of academic papers and deepened my understanding of my subject, namely the link between our medical data and the existential risks associated with it. As for the technical aspects and the website itself, I tried my best to make it aesthetically pleasing, despite my difficulties in dealing with the "technology". I immediately adopted the use of GitHub to write my essay in order to get used to its conventions and not have too many difficulties with the final layout. As for the essay itself, I tried my best to write in academic style and to present my arguments as scientifically as possible. In the end, I'm happy with my performance because I was able to manage my time fairly well ( by finishing my work around mid-December) and because I worked as part of a team with my classmates to improve the quality of my work.

I find 2300278's work both insightful and very interesting. Despite its complexity, the subject she has chosen is very well explained in a clear and understandable way. 2300278 has also found many good references and has integrated them well into her analysis. The only small thing that I think could be improved is the lack of colour or visuals that could help keep the reader's attention when reading her website. Apart from this detail, 2300278's plan is easy to follow and allows for a fluid reading of her work. I really like the fact that she has included a number of possible improvements towards the end of her analysis to end on a more positive note.
